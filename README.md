## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I focused on improving my use of CSS custom properties (variables) and creating hover effects for better user interaction. Here's a snippet of code that I'm particularly proud of:

```css
/* Hover Effect for Blog Preview Card */
.blog-preview-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-10px);
  box-shadow: 12px 12px 0 0 var(--card-shadow-color);
}
```

This hover effect adds a subtle yet effective visual cue that enhances the user experience.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Deepen my understanding of responsive design techniques.
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Continue improving my JavaScript skills, particularly in making websites more interactive.

### Useful Resources
